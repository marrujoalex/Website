        MongoKitten is a feature-rich MongoDB driver. It supports almost every feature in the book in an easy way.
        It supports SSL, replica sets, sharded clusters and all common authentication mechanisms and administrative commands.
        We have build-in support for common features like Collations and (read/write) concerns as well as standards such as GridFS and DBRef.
        We offer first-class citizen support to aggregated queries and ExtendedJSON and have support for many other features.
        We also implemented home-grown features such as lazy cursor transforms and CollectionSlices to make MongoDB and Swift mix in transparently.
